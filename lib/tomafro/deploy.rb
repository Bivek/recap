# Inspired by [this blog post](https://github.com/blog/470-deployment-script-spring-cleaning), this
# recipe uses git's strengths to deploy applications faster and more simply than the standard
# capistrano deployment.  It deploys apps to a single directory. with no shared, current or releases
# folders and no symlinking.
