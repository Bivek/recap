# A simple, opinionated set of deployment recipes for capistrano, using git, bundler and foreman to
# manage application deployments.

# Most of the documentation can be found with the [main recipe](lib/tomafro/deploy.html), while the
# [bundler](lib/tomafro/deploy/bundler.html) and [foreman](lib/tomafro/deploy/foreman.html) recipes document
# their extensions.
