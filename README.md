[tomafro-deploy](http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro-deploy) is a simple, EXPERIMENTAL, opinionated set of capistrano deployment recipes, using git's strengths to deploy applications in a fast and simple manner.

It started as a playaround with git, and is slowly evolving into something useful (though it isn't there) yet.  There are lots of gaps, and half-thought-through ideas.  Also, it needs a proper name.
